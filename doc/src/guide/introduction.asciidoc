== Introduction

Gun is an Erlang HTTP client with support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Websocket.

=== Prerequisites

Knowledge of Erlang, but also of the HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Websocket
protocols is required in order to read this guide.

=== Supported platforms

Gun is tested and supported on Linux.

Gun is developed for Erlang 19+.

Gun may be compiled on earlier Erlang versions with small source code
modifications but there is no guarantee that it will work as intended.

=== Conventions

In the HTTP protocol, the method name is case sensitive. All standard
method names are uppercase.

Header names are case insensitive. Gun converts all the header names
to lowercase, and expects your application to provide lowercase header
names.

The same applies to any other case insensitive value.

=== Versioning

Gun uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
