= gun(7)

== Name

gun - Erlang HTTP client with support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Websocket.

== Dependencies

The `gun` application uses the Erlang applications `ranch`
for abstracting TCP and TLS over a common interface, and
the `ssl` application for TLS support, required for HTTPS
and secure HTTP/2 support. In addition, Gun requires the `crypto`
application (a dependency of `ssl`) for Websocket.

These dependencies must be started for the `gun`
application to work. In an embedded environment
this means that they need to be started with the
`application:start/{1,2}` function before the `gun`
application is started.

== Environment

The `gun` application does not define any application
environment configuration parameters.
